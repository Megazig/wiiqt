this program downloads files from NUS.  currently it supports installing them to an extracted nand dump for use in sneek/dolphin.
downloaded files can be cached to a local file so next time you try to download that title, you wont need to get it from NUS.

TODO...
saving content to a seperate folder and packing wads is only partially done
