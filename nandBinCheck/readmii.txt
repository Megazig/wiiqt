this is a simple cli program to check a nand.bin for various things...
boot1/2 info, fs integrity, signatures, hashes, ecc, hmac, lost clusters, and title sanity.

i have written this as an aide to help debugging the write functions in the nand.bin class.  but it likely will serve other purposes.

run it with no args to see the usage/options
